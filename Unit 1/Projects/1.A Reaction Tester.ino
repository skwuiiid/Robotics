// Unit 1 Digital Sandbox
// Project 1.A Reaction Tester

// Create a game that will test a userâ€™s reaction speed! 
// The user picks a number between 4 and 8 (in their head, not the program).
// he program will cycle through lights D4-D8 at one of two speeds depending on difficulty level, and the user will press the button to stop the cycle on the LED that matches their number.

int ledOn = 4; // Initializing the variable and making it start off at D4
int dspee; // Initialized the delay in between each loop

void setup(){ // Setting up all the LEDs and buttons
  pinMode(2, INPUT);
  pinMode(12, INPUT);
  
  pinMode(4, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(5, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(6, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(7, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
}

void loop(){
  if (digitalRead(12) == HIGH) { // if button is pressed, keep LED on
    digitalWrite(ledOn, HIGH);
  }

  else { // if button isn't pressed, keep LED off
    digitalWrite (ledOn, LOW);
    ledOn = ledOn + 1; // switches the LED to the next to it

    if (ledOn == 9) { // checks whether or not it passes D8
      ledOn = 4; // if it does, it switches back to the beginning at D4
    }
  }

  digitalWrite(ledOn, HIGH); // turned on each LED

  if (digitalRead(2) == HIGH) { // checks the difficulty the person wanted the program in
    dspee = 50; // faster leds for the harder difficulty
  }

  else {
    dspee = 150; // slower leds for the easier difficulty
  }

  delay(dspee); // the interval in between each LED
}
